# Palworld-Dedicated-Server-Editor
This is a small python program to help edit Palworld dedicated server settings for those hosting servers between friends on their own machines.

This application aims to make editing the dedicated server settings on your own system much easier than editing the file directly. It isn't super clean, but it allows a little ease of use.

I'm open to PR and what not to make this better. I'm guessing this won't be super useful after a few updates to the game, but in the meantime I hope it is useful.


NOTE: Anti-virus doesn't like pyinstaller so if you don't want to exclude the exe file from your antivirus, you'll just need to install python and run the code file from there.
